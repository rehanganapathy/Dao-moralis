# Dao-moralis
A Decentralised autonomous organisation using solidity for the smart contract, moralis servers to store votes, and react for the front-end. 
I cretaed the tokens for these using thirdweb, pretty hand fro creating ERC standard tokens or NFTs, moralis lets only server as part of its free plan, a bummer, but still works, and hardhat has been to run the deploy file, i find it so much better than truffle for projects that i work on.
